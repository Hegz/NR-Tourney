  * Fixed a bug preventing the standings from being viewed before the round
  had been advanced once.

  * Round will now auto advance after the last score has been entered, or
  display the final standings if it's the last round.

  * Added the ability to mark players as Disabled for standings.

  * Added Administrator override menu for disable / enable players, and manual
  score adjustments, not yet functional.
